27/05/2025 - Set up the repo for the Hunt the Wumpus project. 
Spent some time learning about the orignal 1973 game
Created the cave class document and wrote the first attribute (name and description).
30/05/2025 - Write the main.py program to call the class and make the first cave object.
Modified the attribute to set up name on iniitalisation
Wrote setter and getter methods for each attribute> Started planning the layout of the caves
02/06/2025 - Wrote a dictionary attribute to store the links to other caves objects.
Wrote and tested a method to print the linked_caves dictionary to the terminal.
03/06/2025 - Added code to the main program to allow the player to move between 
different cave objects. Set up a new Character class and test program. 
Created "Harry - The smelly, dirty Wumpus" in the tst program and tested the conversations method.
04/06/2025 - Created and tested a weakness character for Wumpus, also created Enemy. Added an ability (weakness) for characters to use as an advantage to beat the smelly Wumpus. 
Character is able to fight with what they want to choose, also created a weakness for the wumpus. Created new defines ( combat item, weakness, fight, and more)
06/06/2025 - Finished testing the chracter in the char_test.py file. Added harry object to the main program and added it to the dungeon object, Reworked the main loop to report if a chracter is in a cave. Added more code to the main loop to accept different inputs(moving, talking and fighting) - still need to finish the code to manage fighting.
10/06/2025 - Finished tutorial, starting to add own things
16/06/2025 - Replaced linked.caves with more directions and replace them with new attribute names, began to organise all attributes of each named linked cave. Starting to expand and make more rooms for the character to start going to, expanding on the game to have more options and more places to go. Kind of struggled at the beginnging when i was finding what was making the orginal directions for the character to go but ended up finding it on my own without asking AI to help me find. Once i found this, it was pretty smooth from there and js tweaked what i wanted to tweak today.
17/06/2025 - I created links towards mutiple areas around my coding, able to go back and forth and interact with a new character called Owner. This was kind of a struggle figuring out but got it done. Also made a lower.() so that if a user types something in lowercase it still works instead of crashing. Was kind of hard but is okay.
18/06/2025 - Created new cave called Boss fight Arena, this is where harry the big wumpus is going to be. Was a confusing but understood once got guidance by bradley. Easy to make
27/06/2025 - Created a new file for inventory, creating a key for a character to pick up and use for the basement that requires a key. Was kind of confusing at first but asked for help with comrades and they made it make sense and know planning to fix and finish this inventory file later on during weekend and next week. Putting it all together and then finish the coding and start on documentation.
04/06/2025 - I fixed alot of the inventory.py and main.py, it took some time to figure out and asked copilot if there is any errors that i need to fix. asking where the errors is and it helped me, i understand where i went wrong though was abit troublesome with organising all the if and else statements in both main and inventory py's, overall, went rough but understood and learnt something new today on making sure i have everything organised and checking for errors throughout my project. Havent touched in long time due to me being sick and busy of family emergencies.
